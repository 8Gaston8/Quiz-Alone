I fear I may have already begun upon my first visit to your restaurant of culinary miracles, and a long and fruitful relationship was borne out of that visit.\n\nI will begin with the negatives: it was a bit loud in there.\n\nWith that out of the way, I can now begin listing the myriad wonders.\n\nThe server was quick, attentive and knowledgeable. And when I say quick- we were barely finished ordering the coffee and Diet Coke when it was arriving at the table, prepared to exactly as ordered.\n\nWe had ordered several items as gluten free, and the server had the wherewithal to check the rest of the items, and without prompting from us, let us know that the entirety of the order was indeed gluten free, and she even made a few suggestions when we asked about other dishes.\n\nUltimately, the food came out quickly as well.\n\nThe decor of the place was clean, modern, interesting and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nBut the main event: the food.\n\nThe Mac and cheese was not “good for gluten free” it was one of the best Mac and Cheese I have ever had in my life. Served in a hot bowl with stringy cheese below a crust of crisped cheese across the top. And the fried chicken was unmistakably incredible. The breading did not fall off. If you have eaten gluten free fried chicken before, you must know this is a foregone conclusion for the breading. Not here. This was among the best I’ve ever had. The meat was juicy and not dried out and the breading was crisped and complete in its consistency and constitution.\n\nThere were other items, Brussels sprouts, sweet fries, the Nova Benny. All great. Truly. But good lord the Mac and cheese and fried chicken were absolutely confoundingly astounding.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"Fpazrbm_6MI","step_id":"6H9dwoXYEOp","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"YES","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1708870471574,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","separate_appliances":"YES","separate_appliances_fryer":"YES","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"YES","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"YES","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_OUTLINED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733415695989,"menu_type":"DEDICATED_GF_MENU","platform_inserting_data":"MAZRIMON_FMGF","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","classifier_conflicts":[],"in_vetting_process":false},"safety_level":"Celiac friendly"},{"_id":"oMeER_UlIem","lon":-74.0049159,"lat":40.7092773,"title":"Kesté Pizza e Vino","total_recommendations":761,"selected_tags":["GF Options","Italian","Pizza","Dedicated GF Menu","100% Gluten Free","Celiac Friendly","Allergen Friendly","Dinner","Open Late Night","GF Beer","Dedicated GF Fryer","Dedicated GF Kitchen Space","GF Options Marked on Menu","Cocktails","Desserts","Beer","Separate Oven","Lunch","Vegetarian","Vegan","Outdoor Seating","Pet Friendly","Open Late","Delivery"],"address":"77 Fulton St, New York, NY 10038, USA","last_review":"Amazing dinner at this super friendly and knowledgeable pizza spot.

pictured): the mushroom dip with rice crackers and the potato salad with additional ikura. Both were tasty. We also ordered the caviar service and saved some to have with our temaki.\n\nThe recommended number of temaki to order per person here is 5. I went with some classics and some less traditional fillings. The nori was crisp and the fillings and toppings were fresh and tasty. My favorites of the ones I tried were the Aka Ebi and The Triple.\n\nFor dessert we tried both the cookies and the mochi churros with lemon curd and they were delicious.\n\nI would definitely return for another meal.

Vegan friendly but options are oddly not labeled. Same with vegetarian. You have to go through the process with your server, which, for a first-timer during the lunch rush, slows down the line considerably. Seems like a miss especially when the online menu has a “sort by diet” filter. (Wait, the pickled ginger is not vegan?!) Menu does state that everything is gluten-free and marks the seasonal ingredients.\n\nFor the ready-made, the beet falafel bowl is already vegan, no subs needed. To make your own, avoid the spicy cold noodles, the shaved Brussels sprouts (with pecorino), and the smoky maple carrots. The regular sauces are all vegan.

Needed many gluten-free options with low risk of cross contamination.\n\nAsked the host. She smiled and went on and on about how they've got a separate prep area, fryalaters, etc. showed me the menu with dietary restrictions clearly spelled out.\n\nThe kid went gaga with the menu. Such hungry eyes as he isn't used to having so many choices.\n\nWe ordered: virgin Pina colada, tortilla soup, ropa vieja, chicken Empanada, maduros, chicken encrusted with plantain with mango bbq sauce, and chips with guacamole. Green plantains.\n\nPina colada was made without a mix. Shared with the kid. He loved it!!!\n\nMy wife loved the soup. The kid didn't care for it as he's used to an Americanized Mexican version. Columbian is quite different. More leftovers for her! HUGE portion for $11. Consider it a meal in itself.\n\nMy wife loved the ropa vieja but barely made a dent. Kid tried it.\n\nEmpanada was a huge hit with the kid, as were the plantains and guacamole. We all shared it, and I fought for the guacamole. So good! Chips didn't seem like they were made on premises but were fine.\n\nMy wife and I enjoyed the chicken. Only finished half. Two huge slices of chicken. Took home half. Had to ask for more sauce.\n\nStaff kept our drinks topped off. Picked up things the kid dropped several times. Very careful with dietary restrictions and knew all recipes immediately when asked. Host had already made server and kitchen aware.\n\nExtremely affordable for nyc for authentic Columbian cuisine.\n\nThis kid is begging his parents to return!\n\nGot GF needs? Come here.

My wife and I frequent this location 2-3 times per month, usually on our sole date night each week and no matter how many times we come, the food always hits, the service is consistently excellent and the experience is spectacular.\n\nBy now we’ve tried pretty much everything on the menu and it’s refreshing to see that they keep changing up the specials based on seasonal availability of ingredients. We’ve seen so many delicious additions like lamb loin carpaccio, seared diver scallops, lobster risotto, clam pasta (similar to vongole) and even boar chops. We also noticed certain menu items might get tweaked, for example the crab on the squid ink spaghetti may get switched with shrimp. Or the charred octopus once was switched for jumbo shrimp in garlic and chili. No matter what though, every dish is very well balanced, seasoned perfectly and made with high quality ingredients. I don’t have a gluten intolerance, but it’s worth noting that this restaurant also offers gluten free pizza and pasta.\n\nAppetizers: Our go-to here is the Tuscan Kale salad – now I don’t even like kale, but this salad is shredded and dressed in a delicious blend of pistachio pesto you can barely tell it’s made of kale and brussels. I taste some acid from either mustard or vinegar and it’s finished with pecorino shavings. My wife is obsessed with this dish. We also always get the Charred Octopus which comes with an earthy eggplant puree, made like a hummus and paired with grilled peppers – incredible flavor. I would also recommend the Focaccia & Ricotta, it’s simple but tastes super fresh with a nice drizzle of honey.\n\nPasta: The Pappardelle Bolognese is second to none in the city. It is hands down my single favorite dish on the menu. The ragu is made with pork and veal and has a deep richness from the fat that complements the light tomato flavor of the sauce. The Spaghetti Squid Ink is probably my second favorite. It has a really pleasant seafood flavor that gets cut by the acidity of the cherry tomatoes and chili. We eat these two pastas often.\n\nPizza: Emporio’s pizzas are absolutely sublime. They have an open kitchen concept with the oven facing the dining room. I don’t know how they do it, but you get this perfect light char on the outside of the crust and the bottom is crispy without drying out the toppings. Their dough is rolled out super thin, even thinner than your typical NY slice – and the toppings are generous with a narrow crust. This is a Roman-style pizza and is usually what I prefer vs thick doughy pizzas or even Neapolitans. I’m a sucker for sopressata, so the Spicy Sopressata is an obvious winner for me. They also use a very mild mozzarella that doesn’t impart so much cheesiness that it overpowers the ingredients or the sauce.\n\nMains: While not the same as what you would find at a NY steakhouse, the NY Strip Tagliata is a well-executed dish on its own. It comes with roasted garlic and caramelized onion and is sliced for sharing. I demolish this even after crushing apps, pizza and pasta, it’s that good. The Branzino Fillet was also nice, but a smaller portion than the steak.\n\nDessert: Finally, I always have room for dessert given my sweet tooth. The Nutella Calzone is a pastry of the gods, just decadent and chocolatey with a chewy dough covering. Meanwhile the Panna Cotta is also excellent if you want to something lighter. And the Tiramisu is the best in the city. Generous portion with soaked lady fingers and mouthfuls of mascarpone and cocoa powder. Yes, I have a major sweet tooth.\n\nAll in all, Emporio is an 11 out of 10. It’s the best of the best. I wake up on Mondays looking forward to eating there on the weekend and I dream about gorging on pizza and pasta from my favorite restaurant in NYC. Can’t recommend this place enough","gf_criterias":{"_id":"fYdwQ_NBBKe","step_id":"4F4Zf1HR8Bu","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1708870479292,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733415561291,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN"},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"uGXUzKEViTs","lon":-73.98658,"lat":40.677032,"title":"Everybody Eats","total_recommendations":52,"selected_tags":["GF Options","Celiac Friendly","Vegan Options","Vegetarian Options","Dairy Free Options","Bakery","Take Away","Grab & Go","Allergen Friendly","Kid Friendly","100% GF Restaurant","GF Menu","Dedicated GF Kitchen Space","Sandwiches","Knowledgeable Staff","Bread Items","Separate Oven","Separate GF Menu","Bagels","Desserts","100% GF","Delivery"],"address":"294 3rd Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215, USA","last_review":"I commissioned my birthday cake from here after being faced with lots of stomach issues the past year.

From the moment we stepped inside, we were enveloped in a warm and inviting atmosphere. The friendly staff made us feel right at home, and the rustic decor and cozy ambiance created the perfect setting for a delightful dining experience.\n\nThe menu boasts a wide variety of options to cater to every palate. Whether you’re a burger enthusiast or prefer plant-based alternatives, Bareburger has something for everyone. I decided to indulge in the Sweet Bison Blues burger, and it was an absolute delight! The all-natural bison was cooked to perfection, and the harmonious blend of aged blue cheese, caramelized onion, and bacon bourbon jam infused each bite with an explosion of flavor. The juicy burger was perfectly seasoned and nestled on a fresh and fluffy bun.\n\nFor sides, the sweet potato fries and Honey Brussels sprouts were absolute standouts. Both were cooked to perfection, achieving the ideal balance of crispiness on the outside and tenderness on the inside. If you’re a sauce connoisseur, you’ll be delighted to know that Bareburger offers an array of sauces that add a unique and delectable twist to each dish.\n\nOne of the most commendable aspects of Bareburger is their unwavering commitment to inclusivity. They cater to various dietary preferences by offering vegan, gluten-free, and keto-friendly options that don’t compromise on taste. My friend, who opted for the My Sunshine (a vegan burger), couldn’t stop raving about it for hours.\n\nThe service at Bareburger was exceptional. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu, provided excellent recommendations, and ensured our entire meal was attended to with utmost care. It’s evident that the staff at Bareburger genuinely cares about their food and the well-being of their customers.\n\nIn conclusion, if you’re seeking a place that offers delectable, high-quality burgers, a welcoming atmosphere, and accommodating dietary options, Bareburger is the ideal destination. I eagerly anticipate my next visit to explore more of their menu items and continue to savor the exceptional dining experience they provide. Highly recommend this culinary gem to anyone who appreciates a great burger and a memorable dining experience.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"luq-haEYCbW","step_id":"ibAOJKfRUvw","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"YES","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1708870553101,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","separate_appliances":"YES","separate_appliances_fryer":"YES","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"NOT_APPLICABLE","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_OUTLINED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733418288353,"menu_type":"GF_OPTIONS_MARKED","platform_inserting_data":"MAZRIMON_FMGF","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","classifier_conflicts":[{"field":"trained_staff","current_value":"YES","classifier_value":"NO"}],"in_vetting_process":false},"safety_level":"Celiac friendly"},{"_id":"i8LsyFrCXFi","lon":-73.96614129999999,"lat":40.7943486,"title":"Bareburger","total_recommendations":22,"selected_tags":["Lunch","Dinner","Brunch","Open Late","Burgers","Delivery","Take Away","Kid Friendly","Celiac Friendly","Bread Items","Beer","Fries","Dairy Free","Vegan","Vegetarian","Dedicated GF Fryer","Bar"],"address":"795 Columbus Ave, New York, NY 10025, USA","last_review":"Our server Wellington went above and beyond to accommodate our tables dietary restrictions.

On my last trip to NYC, we stopped in several locations in Little Italy to ask if they had gluten and dairy free cannolis and while we were able to find gluten free shells, the vegan or dairy free filling proved impossible to find. Thus, you can imagine my surprise/excitement to read that John’s of 12th Street was offering this and had a separate vegan menu as well!\n\nI arrived on a Saturday evening without a reservation and they were kind enough to fit me in because I was by myself (I don’t recommend coming without a reservation; the restaurant was super busy!). The waitstaff was extremely friendly and welcoming and knowledgeable about gluten free and vegan options. I was ready to order the gluten free pasta with marinara when it occurred to me to ask what was in the marinara. Surprisingly, there is butter. I’m dairy free in addition to gluten free, so the server guided me to the vegan option which does not contain butter. The pasta arrived very quickly, and with it a container of Follow Your Heart vegan parmesan which I felt was a very thoughtful touch as I can’t remember the last time I was able to have parmesan with my pasta at a restaurant (also shows how vegan friendly this restaurant is!). The sauce itself was not what I had envisioned with marinara sauce, it was really heavy on the garlic and had green onions in it. It was okay, but I would probably try a different sauce if I went back again.\n\nThen the time came for the gluten free, vegan cannoli. Relatively pricey at ~10/cannoli, it arrived and I immediately was confused. The shell is not what I would expect for a cannoli… it was a pizzelle (a waffle cookie) rolled into the shape of a cannoli shell. The filling was also not what I expected—it wasn’t traditional, but had a mix of spices that were reminiscent of fall and pumpkin pie. It wasn’t my favorite, especially at the price point, but I have to give them major kudos for catering to a gluten free and vegan community and offering an abundance of options, including a dessert option which is so rare to find. If ever back in NYC, I would consider eating here again as it felt like a safe place to eat for someone who is gluten and dairy free like myself.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"xZLid5cCZgU","step_id":"s6fqzudLkFv","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1708870470319,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","separate_appliances":"YES","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"YES","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_OUTLINED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733418912773,"menu_type":"GF_OPTIONS_MARKED","platform_inserting_data":"RETOOL","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"YES","in_vetting_process":false},"safety_level":"Celiac friendly"},{"_id":"nAA1dRZyC9s","lon":-74.0035359,"lat":40.7428238,"title":"Locanut","total_recommendations":17,"selected_tags":["GF Options","Vegan Options","Allergen Friendly","Celiac Friendly","Burgers","Breakfast","Brunch","Dairy Free Options","Delivery","Dinner","Lunch","Take Away","Vegetarian Options","Bread Items","Desserts","Pasta","Sandwiches","100% GF","Pet Friendly"],"address":"361 W 17th St, New York, NY 10011, USA","last_review":"Tons of delicious healthy gluten free options!","gf_criterias":{"_id":"oMdqHHe-Fhc","step_id":"nAA1dRZyC9s","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"YES","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1708870533772,"dedicated_gf_place":"YES","separate_appliances":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"NOT_APPLICABLE","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_FILLED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733418590788,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","platform_inserting_data":"MAZRIMON_FMGF","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","classifier_conflicts":[],"in_vetting_process":false},"safety_level":"100% Dedicated Gluten-Free"},{"_id":"YYqJsS2RT99","lon":-73.9534583,"lat":40.7245208,"title":"Uzuki","total_recommendations":17,"selected_tags":["Lunch","Dinner","Asian","Delivery","Celiac Friendly","100% GF","Kid Friendly"],"address":"95 Guernsey St, Brooklyn, NY 11222, USA","last_review":"the best soba i’ve ever had in my life. beautiful atmosphere and interior design. felt like a cozy, loving home. everyone was attentive. the space is fun and filled with detail, welcoming. truffle soba gluten free and delicious. i will be back many times, love. koto","gf_criterias":{"_id":"pRio-MJctqs","step_id":"YYqJsS2RT99","based_on_user_reviews":false,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1711634533667,"dedicated_gf_place":"YES","separate_appliances":"YES","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"YES","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_FILLED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733417560923,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","platform_inserting_data":"MAZRIMON_FMGF","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"YES","classifier_conflicts":[],"is_dedicated_gluten_free_from_fmgf":true,"in_vetting_process":false},"safety_level":"100% Dedicated Gluten-Free"},{"_id":"Xu5fI7crJ1b","lon":-74.0028038,"lat":40.7331487,"title":"Two Boots West Village","total_recommendations":17,"selected_tags":["GF Options","Pizza","Lunch","Dinner","Open Late","Delivery","Take Away","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly"],"address":"101 7th Ave S, New York, NY 10014, USA","last_review":"Favorite place to go if you’re looking for an elevated version of the classic New York style slice.

From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted by a charming ambiance, highlighted by a beautifully decorated wall of elephants that instantly transported us to Thailand. We visited on a chilly, winter weekday, and it was pretty quiet inside, but we didn't mind at all!\n\nAs we perused the menu, we were intrigued by their seasonal winter offerings and decided to try the oxtail pho. Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! The oxtail was incredibly tender, practically melting in my mouth, and the broth was bursting with flavor. It was the perfect dish to warm me up on a chilly day, and the addition of gluten-free rice noodles made it even more enjoyable for me, as someone with gluten sensitivities.\n\nMy sister opted for the chicken fried rice, which was equally impressive. Packed with flavor and just the right amount of heat, it was a comforting and satisfying choice. For appetizers, we couldn't resist the steamed dumplings, filled with a delicious blend of chicken, shrimp, and veggies. The accompanying sauce was a delightful complement to the dumplings, adding an extra layer of flavor.\n\nOne aspect that truly stood out was the attentive and friendly service. In an age where good service can be hard to come by, we were impressed by the staff's warm hospitality and attentiveness throughout our meal. It truly enhanced our overall dining experience and made us feel welcome and valued as guests.\n\nTo top it all off, they offer a fantastic selection of non-alcoholic beverages, including the lychee Earl Gray iced tea, which was a refreshing and delightful choice. I hear their Thai iced tea is amazing, but unfortunately I am lactose intolerant, so I had to pass on it!\n\nAnd let's not forget about the takeout experience! I ordered the Chili Garlic Crispy Pork Belly for my husband, and he absolutely loved it. He devoured every last bite, and said it had the perfect amount of heat. I stole a bite of the pork and it was so good, even after sitting in my car ride to the airport for over 40 minutes!!\n\nOverall, our experience at Plue Thai was nothing short of fantastic.

I would absolutely stay here again and will be recommending to others. The staff is fabulous (I was helped many times by Christina, Cory, Lydia, and others whose names I don't know unfortunately). Everything was clean, and the whole hotel is very chic, unique, and cute. Really fun place to stay. Had a great view from our room without even paying extra, and got to stay on the 12th floor per my call-in request prior to be on a higher floor if possible. Each floor is very small, maybe like 8 rooms(??), so it was really very quiet! The club and restaurants on the lobby floor did not create any noise for us from our rooms either!\n\nOrdered lots of room service from the cafe, the avocado toast and the burger were both fantastic, and they have GLUTEN FREE both toast and buns!! (The food was ofc quite pricey for me, but it's an NYC hotel, so it's expected).\n\nFront desk often held things for me when I was rushing out quickly and didn't want to go back up to my room to put something away (like an extra jacket), and also held our bags for free after checkout.\n\nCONS: (very minimal and wouldn't stop me from staying here again) But there were some basic things lacking in the room, like a microwave or hot water maker, that would have really added to the convenience of our trip.

I adore this place and love bringing people here to show off the neighborhood. The platter for two is massive and can really feed three people. Everything is vegetarian! Gluten free injera bread is available but it is first come first serve, as they only make a limited amount per day.

The gluten-free crust was surprisingly really good. The only noticeable difference was that it was a bit thinner than the regular crust. The roasted garlic on the Mimi was fantastic.\n\nI wouldn't come here for the burger personally. It's pretty expensive and nothing too special. The burger is cooked well, and the sauce is very flavorful, but I wish that they had more sauce in the burger because the burger tasted pretty standard otherwise. Didn't mind the pretzel bun. The fries are meh. If you are a burger person, then you're not missing out on much if you don't try it.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"A2oK-oVo18K","step_id":"bEsguffLqtv","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1708870479292,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_DOTTED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733417804708,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","platform_inserting_data":"RETOOL","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","in_vetting_process":false},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"TK51DJNkU4-","lon":-73.9847563,"lat":40.7593835,"title":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","total_recommendations":11,"selected_tags":["GF Options","Wine Bar","Seafood","Italian","Dinner","Kid Friendly","Open Late Night","Take Away","Pasta","Lunch","Brunch","Mediterranean","Delivery"],"address":"2 Times Sq, New York, NY 10020, USA","last_review":"We sat down to eat and there was an option for gluten-free pizza and pasta.

It had been my third time at the restaurant and yet AGAIN, it is still my favorite.\n\nI was introduced to the restaurant by Scott Burnhard and it has become one of my most priced vegan eateries ever since.\n\nOn this special Sunday, my roommate Azali and I were fortunate enough to meet the owners. An older couple, Mercedes & Angel, DEDICATED to health and clean eating!\n\nWhen asking questions about the creation of the menu, Angel is the orchestrator behind it all! He gives the chefs and cooks the concepts, and they create the genius masterpieces.\n\nAnd by gawd, that menu IS GENIUS! Completely creative and exceptionally innovative.\n\nIf you LOVE plant based food, this is a PLANT BASED HEAVEN!\n\nI quoted Angel on something that he said, that truly touched me. “[We] make food for the sick & the healthy,” he mentioned. “This food makes sick people healthy, and it keeps the healthy people healthy.”\n\nI LOVE that concept. It’s truly commitment to sustenance and healing.\n\nHis wife, Mercedes, was amazing as well, when talking about the best, most optimal way to receive food, she wisely told us, “I used to think we are what we eat, now I understand we are what we absorb.”\n\nPreparation on how to receive the BEST nutrients from food is even more important than the food itself!\n\nBut let’s get into the DETAILS!\n\nThere is LIVE Music Daily at 7:30pm, so please come to dinner and catch a vibe.\n\nOur waiter, Christian, was AMAZING!!\n\nHe first served us the Seitan Nachos, which were savory, flavorful, and absolutely delicious. Easily one of my favorite appetizers.\n\nThe owner, Angel also insisted that we try the Warm Hummus & Pesto Zattar. TO DIE FOR!\n\nWe were offered the Peanut Sesame Noodles which are, Gluten Free, Organic Noodles made from Quinoa! I thought that was so cool! There is of course peanut butter, made in-house and topped with sesame seeds. I’d describe this dish as very subtle! So, not my favorite, since I prefer food packed with flavor. It is a light peanut sauce, served warm and has a very very slight sweetness.\n\nThere is a complimentary side Salad that comes with EVERY Entrée. And my roommate ordered the RAW Pizzetta, while I ordered the Huitlacoche and Chorizo Quesadilla.\n\nAzali said the Pizzetta was BOMB! She described the dough as a happy medium between chewy and crunchy. She described the taste of the pizza sauce as creamy with a bit of a tangy flavor.\n\nThe Huitlacoche and Chorizo Quesadilla was INCREDIBLE! It was super spicy, which was a shock to me, and it’s served with a vinaigrette micro green salad, fresh diced mango, and a dipping sauce. The flavors were literally a perfect balance and the dish was BIG and incredibly filling. SO GOOD OMG!\n\nFor drinks, I ordered the Hibiscus Iced Tea, of which I added a lot of agave — it comes unsweetened. And Azali ordered the Organic Piña Colada. She said it was delicious.\n\nFor dessert, we chose to share the Warm Brownie Sundae which came with coconut cream based icecream & coconut whipped cream atop baked, rich dark chocolate brownies and fresh, sliced, strawberries.\n\nAngel also offered us Pancakes. Which are the most tasty Gluten Free, Sugar Free, and Dairy Free treats you will ever taste. They came with blueberries inside. And he requested a scoop of both house made strawberry & chocolate icecream, with two small mounds of coconut whipped cream. Literally so good! And that STAWBERRY ICE CREAM?!

Tight dining space. Limited/small menu. Food was okay/good; the braised lamb fell apart like butter, but flavor wise could have used some seasoning.

My wife and I were in Manhattan, New York for an 8 day vacation staying at the Hotel Beacon on Broadway not far from this cafe. Good coffee shops are hard to find..exceptional ones even harder ! After very average coffees on Saturday and Sunday in Manhattan we knew there had to be better. My wife found this Bluestone Lane location online and this place was going to be our first port of call early on Monday morning. In fact it was just a 10 minute walk here discovering fun new places along the way like a French bakery we later visited. When we arrived around 8.30am the staff were all wearing facial masks ( in New York City it was mandated to wear facial masks in public etc during our stay ) but we still felt their happy smiles. We were offered to sit at a table inside the very cosy cafe. A happy very interesting server named Matthew ( we assumed he was the manager ) came over to say hi. There was a QR Code menu stuck on the table top but these guys also had a very sophisticated online ordering system off their own website. We were still getting used to some East Coast terminologies as we discussed with Matt the type of coffee we should order...a Flat White ( Aussie term we don't hear in Southern California ), a Latte ( always our fav back home ) or a Cappuccino ( which Matthew recommended as the model they made which suited our tastes the best ). We went with 2 x CAPPUCCINOS ! Sticking with their digital ordering system displayed on our iPhones my wife went with SCRAMBLED EGGS, BACON & TOAST with Jam ( thick multigrain gluten free too ) while I wanted HARD POACHED EGGS, BACON & TOAST with VEGEMITE ( that's when we realized there must be an AUSSIE CONNECTION here ). Of course Matthew had earlier introduced himself as an expat West Australian and a working theatre actor. We were informed that an Aussie ( from Melbourne ) named Nick Stone started Bluestone Lane on the West Coast a few years ago. HOW COOL ! After further research on Wiki we discovered that Bluestone Lane has cafes & coffee shops at 51 locations all over the USA. Our incredible looking Cappuccinos arrived courtesy of Matthew who made them perfectly. WOW there was something special going on here...our cappuccinos tasted as good as anything anywhere anytime ! So good we later bought a 12oz bag of Maverick whole roasted coffee beans ( their house blend ) to take home. Our breakfast order arrived thanks to Meriel the food runner and looked so cute...plated individually ( because every item was ordered as a side ). WHOOPEE...I had been having VEGEMITE withdrawal symptoms after just 3 days away from home. BREAKFAST WAS SENSATIONAL...my hard poached eggs were perfect, the delicate delicious strips of bacon were like prosciutto. My wife totally enjoyed her perfect texture scrambled eggs and loved the wispy bacon like me. The thick multigrain toast ( 2 slices ) was delicious with vegemite or jam. We came back here every morning for breakfast or just coffees. All the staff we interacted with here ( Matthew, Rachel, Matt, Sylvie, Amanda..an Aussie from Sydney, Bryan & Meriel were SUPER FRIENDLY and provided EXCELLENT SERVICE every visit. Most coffee shops in the USA which we have encountered copy the Starbucks dumb down model..take your order at the counter and then yell out your name to come & get it in a paper cup...not Bluestone Lane who know how to pamper you at your table. It's like going to see your personal coffee therapist...you leave feeling REAL GOOD every time !","gf_criterias":{"_id":"YzgpnpVLSrG","step_id":"LmhQXQpTCf1","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"YES","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1708870532562,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","separate_appliances":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_OUTLINED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733416719074,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN"},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"GP_yM8mtrvg","lon":-74.0005643,"lat":40.7480998,"title":"Citizens Of Chelsea, A Breakfast Restaurant","total_recommendations":10,"selected_tags":["Breakfast","Lunch","Brunch","Sandwiches","Celiac Friendly","GF Options","Vegan Options","Vegetarian Options","Bread Items","Knowledgeable Staff","Dinner","Cafe","Delivery","Take Away","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly","Restaurant"],"address":"401 W 25th St, New York, NY 10001, USA","last_review":"MJ gave us excellent service!!

I have Celiac and it’s devastating to not be able to go through a fast food drive thru or sit down at a diner and order whatever I want to. I won’t eat at dining facilities who offer “gluten free burger bun options” because of the high chance of cross contact with gluten. So, when I found Springy, I was ecstatic! Their food did not disappoint. Their burgers, fries, and milkshakes are DELICIOUS and their facility is 100% gluten free!! Thank you Springbone for creating Springy Burger and Fries because you are providing a real need to those with Celiac like myself and it is extremely appreciated.

I am picky and here there is nothing to be picky about. Today, I had an oat milk latte, salmon cake sandwich on gluten free bread which came with salad.\n\nThe latte was creamy and delicious! The bread was excellent didn’t impact taste given it was gluten free. The salmon cake came with horseradish sauce. Some places use horseradish due to its strong taste and it can be overpowering however, not here. The horseradish sauce blended well to add to and bring out the flavor of the salmon cake.\n\nWhat a nice salad! Nice fresh greens with beets. The dressing was made with beets and was light, tasty and not too sweet. It was an excellent side to the salmon cake.\n\nBetween the salmon cake, sauce, salad, beet dressing and latte I walked away feeling well nourished and my taste buds had a satisfying experience.\n\nThe place is very comfy with seating well placed in many areas to choose from. Out front, the bar, dining area and backyard which is enclosed and temperature controlled. I sat at the bar.\n\nWhile I was sipping my latte before my food arrived I noticed the bartender was wiping down every bottle of the full bar. I was very impressed and asked her how often she did this and she said every week. Another great thing about this place is the cleanliness, the work they put into cleaning shows and as a clean freak so, appreciate this. You can tell when you walk in the place has a sparkle.\n\nLastly, I had a knapsack that I put on the stool next to me. The hostess was so thoughtful she placed my bag on one of the hooks under the bar. They think of everything to keep the place pleasant, friendly and welcoming.\n\nLeft wanting to come back to try other dishes. Highly recommend dining here.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"VkRIUGeQRNm","step_id":"lVHgBwiFnzg","based_on_user_reviews":false,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1711648522687,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","in_vetting_process":false,"separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_DOTTED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733418477967,"menu_type":"GF_OPTIONS_NOT_MARKED","platform_inserting_data":"MAZRIMON_FMGF","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","classifier_conflicts":[]},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"j2FwhuVPOaV","lon":-73.9797528,"lat":40.7511753,"title":"Fields Good Chicken","total_recommendations":8,"selected_tags":["GF Options","Grab & Go","Take Away","Lunch","Dinner","Delivery","Kid Friendly","Restaurant"],"address":"26 E 40th St, New York, NY 10016, USA","last_review":"greatest spot for lunch. similar prices as every other chain with great gluten free options and solid portions compared to others.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"FYIja93nsl9","step_id":"j2FwhuVPOaV","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":true,"created_at":1708870537544,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_DOTTED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733418317475,"menu_type":"GF_OPTIONS_MARKED","platform_inserting_data":"RETOOL","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","in_vetting_process":false},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"ixzFSHehqTo","lon":-74.0054765,"lat":40.7455564,"title":"Cookshop","total_recommendations":8,"selected_tags":["Lunch","Dinner","Brunch","American","Delivery","Take Away","Pet Friendly","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly","Restaurant"],"address":"156 10th Ave, New York, NY 10011, USA","last_review":"Got the roasted chicken and the green juice.

Goodfellas has found a new home and the gleaming coffered ceiling is the cherry on the icing. The banquet seating is comfortable, the mood is convivial and the staff -- attentive and friendly.  There were 6 of us and the start of dinner was a loaf of home-made, freahly-baked bread along with some olive oil dip with fresh basil. For appetizers we ordered a slew of vegetables sautéed in garlic and olive oil. They were done to perfection! The garlic was soft but not burnt, the vegetables were tender but not overdone. Every entree was hot, the pasta was al dente, the pizzas were crusty yet deliciously chewy with quality toppings like smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions and roasted red pepper cream. The gluten free pizza crust is exceptional as is the pasta. For those who cannot consume gluten this place must be God-sent as many eateries just do not serve anything near as good as Goodfellas when it comes to gluten free options. The wine selection, while not huge, is more than adequate. I cannot speak for the desserts as I do not like sweets, but the  rest of the party raved about the almond cake. Sophia, our server, was funny, quick-witted and attentive. Salt, pepper,  water, napkins, hot honey, lemon slices.... whatever we needed she brought in a timely manner. The chef/owner makes the obligatory rounds to the tables and keeps a watchful eye on the food and staff. We will definitely be going back for the food, live music, crusty bread and relaxing atmosphere.

Dining at Olea felt like a gastronomic journey, each dish a testament to the expertise and passion poured into the menu.\n\nThe highlights? Oh, where to begin! The specials were an absolute delight, but it was the lamb hash, the Olea Breakfast, and that unforgettable egg dish swimming in a rich red sauce that truly stole our hearts (and appetites). Oh! And do not miss out on the croquettes!! And just when we thought our taste buds had peaked, the gluten-free vegan chocolate cake made an appearance. Admittedly, it leaned towards the drier side, but the accompanying caramel sauce was so divine, we were tempted to ask for a glass of it!\n\nOur server was the epitome of professionalism and warmth, ensuring our dining experience was smooth from start to finish. The only minor hiccup was the bathroom situation - its proximity to the kitchen meant navigating the space required some finesse, a fact I learned after a mild scolding from a busy server. But, let's be honest, a small price to pay for the overall exceptional experience.\n\nOlea, with its delightful dishes and charming setting, is a must-visit in Fort Greene.

Full of Japanese goods will welcome you. They have spacious dining space and backyard where you can access after order your food in the front.\n\nWe had Chicken Nanban Bento Box, Pesto Avocado Sandwich, and Japanese Fried Chicken Karaage. Chicken Nanban is known as Miyazaki Style chicken dish. Fried chicken soaked in sweet vinegar and soy sauce based sauce. Then, they put creamy tartar sauce on the top. Chicken Nanban tastes fresh and crispy. The bento was served with purple rice, salad, Brussels sprouts, and pickled daikon. Pesto avocado sandwich was little citrus and full of fresh greens. They put smashed avocado, dill, basil pesto, and mozzarella cheese. I like citrus and herbs so I loved it so much. Chicken Karaage was also amazing. All food is made to order which made those Karaage so crispy and juicy. On the menu description, they said they put shoyu koji mayonnaise on the top. To me, the sauce had strong mustard flavor.\n\nTheir food feels very healthy and thoughtful. Even the side dishes on the bento had all its role and balance. A lot of gluten free options and some vegetarian options available. My stomach felt really comfortable after consuming their food. I see that their main purpose is to serve fresh, healthy yet hearty food. It is trustworthy to see them pursuing their goal here.\n\nDefinitely going back to Acre with lots of love!","gf_criterias":{"_id":"vSbZ36hrQGU","step_id":"NTCXaZliFAS","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"YES","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1708870732390,"dedicated_gf_place":"NO","separate_appliances":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"GREEN_OUTLINED","last_step_style_revalidation":1733416831296,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","classifier_conflicts":[],"platform_inserting_data":"MAZRIMON_FMGF"},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"NEn35w6b3cJ","lon":-73.9791089,"lat":40.757533599999995,"title":"maman","total_recommendations":6,"selected_tags":["Breakfast","Lunch","Dinner","Brunch","Cafe","Delivery","Take Away","French","Pet Friendly","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly","Restaurant"],"address":"12 W 48th St 4th Floor, New York, NY 10036, USA","last_review":"We visited this morning as there were gluten free options.I had the overnight oats which was just right, not too sweet.\nMy husband had the waffles which were sweet and very nice.\nGreat coffee, we had lattes.

The food to say the least was delicious and of good quality.\n\nI normally don't like diner food because the quality tends to be sub-par and typically the flavors are very bland.  Since that night in April, I have been back to Z-Two almost every weekend with my family, especially since I've relocated to Staten Island.  The food is still very good, the service and the staff are friendly, professional and welcoming, and the prices are very reasonable.  They always have a smile on their faces and love to delight you with funny stories and small talk.  The atmosphere is modern and the restaurant is clean.

We have LOVED this world wide steak-frites-only bistro group for over 40 years (Thank you CdP, Paul De Saurs, and the kind Frenchman on a Pan Am flight so long ago. \"Americans prefer this bistro, delicious steak frites and fast\")\n\nOnly this one of the two  pre-covid NYC bistros is back after too long a wait and in this new location.

We have waited ilonger at the original Parisienne Port Maillot location from old School word-of-mouth.\n\nThe dream of Venice name is because the original location was an Italian restaurant in Paris. PdS took over the lease and kept the then-high-tech neon sign adding \"son Entrecote\" which became simply L'Entrecote. At $34.95 (April 2024) it is a bargain. A walnut & vinaigrette grean salad, two servings of steak (get rare) and unlimited REAL French fries ( ask for more sauce).\n\nIf you stay away from the scraps of bread the meal is gluten-free. (Mop up most of any remaining sauce with the fries, then a scarpetto piece of bread .\n\nOur kids were young the first time we went (RIP Miami location). Of course they loved the French fries but to our surprise also the steak... Start them now. Why?

The chicken was thin and juicy, the noodles were slick with flavorful salt, tons of peanuts to spread around, and of course, a like wedge to tie all the flavors together 😍\n\nThe Vegan khao na ped was also excellent for mock duck. The pieces of “duck” were crispy, flavorful, and not greasy (at some spots, Nick meat can be a bit slimy). Fresh ginger and dipping sauce on the side made this a simple yet flavorful dish, great for vegetarians 🌱\n\nService was friendly and our dishes came out in just around 10 minutes which was fantastic given how hungry we were.\n\nThe space is small so come early, or be okay with a small wait if you come during busy dinner hours (we waited 5 minutes).","gf_criterias":{"_id":"CKSCxOnDt1m","step_id":"TSbkKp10uHn","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1708870534962,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"UNKNOWN","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733417224484,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","in_vetting_process":true},"safety_level":"Gluten-free options"},{"_id":"SSL19zLOnQP","lon":-73.9532596,"lat":40.6600615,"title":"PLG Coffee House and Tavern","total_recommendations":5,"selected_tags":["Breakfast","Lunch","Brunch","Cafe","Delivery","Take Away","Pet Friendly","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly","Restaurant"],"address":"499 Rogers Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11225, USA","last_review":"Because of the gluten-free options, I’ve given this place multiple tries and every time it’s the same.\nLong wait times, regardless of how many people are in front of you.

However, I ordered gluten free pasta, which is only available in one shape at this location, fusilli, and found two pieces of spaghetti in my dish. This means that there was severe cross-contamination, likely cooking the GF pasta in the same pasta water as regular, full-gluten, pasta (I have worked in restaurants, I know how pasta is typically prepared in these environments). There is no point offering gluten free pasta if they are going to clearly and irresponsibly cross contaminate like that, especially since they're charging extra money. It's great that they offer the GF option so people with Celiac disease, like myself, can have more options to eat out with friends, but you endanger customers by using the same pasta water - the dish is no longer gluten free. Luckily, I did not get sick, but that's not a reason to continue with this unsafe practice. If changes are not made, there is no point offering, or claiming that there is, the GF pasta option.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"JYZY7qMV4lR","step_id":"G8qQxWvvq5_","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1708870535576,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733416346379,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN"},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"G4EUolhRlpT","lon":-73.9750294,"lat":40.6867325,"title":"Fritz","total_recommendations":5,"selected_tags":["GF Options"],"address":"737 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11217, USA","last_review":"Fritz’s and veganized in New Brunswick have gf options.

He had seen the Netflix documentary on Blue Hill and it totally inspired him. He planted it in his mind that he wanted to visit Dan Barber's restaurant one day. When I told him I wanted to take him to NYC for his birthday, the first thing he asked to do was to visit here.\nHe raved about the restaurant all the way to NYC. He even had us watch the documentary so we could understand why he was so excited about it.  Before we came, we all had super high expectations. I was kind of worried that our expectations were too high.\nAs the first dish was served and we bit into the raw veggies, we didn't know exactly what we were to expect - after all, how different could a radish be? But we thoroughly enjoyed each bite. When it came to the turnip, we hesitated - raw turnip?  After we took a bite, we looked at each other and almost at the same time said: \"That's a turnip?!\"  It was incredible - sweet - juicy - perfect.  We ate everything - greens and all - it's that good and that fresh.\nWith each dish that was served, we found ourselves transported to a time and place where food was alive - where simple foods tasted incredible all on their own, and where food could be enjoyed without punishing you later.\nWhen we made our reservations, I indicated that my daughter and I were gluten-free and dairy-free.  We always avoid those because we don't do well with the glyphosate found in most wheat products (from Round-up being used on the crops) and the hormones and antibiotics pumped into dairy cows that make their way into the milk.\nAfter we watched the documentary, we decided to drop the restrictions. My daughter was almost in tears as she bit into bread and butter that was so incredibly delicious that she was wishing she could find a way to have it every day.  We all enjoyed the dairy, bread, and every part of each course.  And, hours later, we didn't have to \"pay the price\".  The price had been paid ahead of time by sourcing ingredients that both taste delicious and deliver proper nutrition to the body without any harmful additions. We couldn't have been happier.\nWe enjoyed our meal so much that we decided to change our plans and go back for the Sunday lunch 2 days later.  That was an equally wonderful experience.\nAnd, what meal out is complete without incredible serving staff!  The staff here are wonderful and went out of their way to welcome us and help us celebrate my son's birthday in the perfect way.\nThank you to everyone at Blue Hill Restaurant.

Our food order was also taken quickly. We got the burrata to start and two gluten free pizzas. The burrata was heavenly especially with the warm squash as we were there Nov. 9th, so it was a great autumn touch. The GF pizzas were the best my wife and I have had. I've had a lot of pizza in my day and even been to New Haven, CT (pizza mecca of the world). If you gave me this pizza and told me it was a regular gluten flour pizza I would not have noticed a difference. I'm not saying it was as good as New Haven, but it was VERY good by GF standards. Crust actually had a crisp that GF pizzas never seem to be able to develop. I took a look at the oven when we left and that is definitely a large contributor to its success, but hats off to the chef for the GF flour mixture as well. Price was midtown Manhattan prices, but not over the top and I've paid more for worse GF pizza, so it's well worth it. We were very tired from a long day of work, but I'd love to go back and try a regular pizza (my wife is GF, but I am not) as I'm sure its amazing.

For example: pancakes don't always come out with butter and maple. Toast never comes out with butter and jam. In general, food does not always come out quickly (we've gotten our stuff right away, and some days we've waited almost 30 minutes in between getting our pancakes and our eggs). The potatoes are sometimes the most delicious crispy potatoes you've ever had, and sometimes huge, soggy chunks.

The food and drinks were delicious, the service was good, and the atmosphere was lively. We started with espresso martini's, which were enjoyable, but when it came to cocktails, the real stand out was the fellini. It was a delicious amalgam of bitter and sweet; perfect for the fall. My favorite part of our meal was the clams pasta (we did gluten free). It was a delicious and unique sauce, with just the right amount of spice to take it over the top. The ricotta crostino was delicious for an appetizer, too. The chicory salad was just okay, nothing special. The only qualms I have with Bar Primi were the noise level (it was VERY loud), and the server's request to put in our entire order at once. This new custom of NYC restaurants is off-putting to me; encouraging you to put the entire order in so they can turn the table over as soon as possible. The busboys also circled like vultures and very frequently checked our table to see if we were done; it felt pressuring rather than relaxing. This is NO fault on them as I am sure it is a management directive. As a fellow waitress, I encourage management to rethink these directives with staff as it diminishes what should be a very positive, relaxed dining experience.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"3iCNk3oXkaU","step_id":"iTC1KFpEal1","based_on_user_reviews":false,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1732025927583,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"UNKNOWN","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733418279230,"in_vetting_process":true},"safety_level":"Gluten-free options"},{"_id":"iMPYOfr2py-","lon":-73.9421244,"lat":40.7143405,"title":"Il Passatore","total_recommendations":4,"selected_tags":["Dinner","Brunch","Italian","Delivery","Take Away","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly"],"address":"14 Bushwick Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11211, USA","last_review":"Love this restaurant so much!

Should be stripped of their michelin star until they can get their front-of-house in order.\n\nReview: I'm just going to rip the band-aid off now, and say in all of my years of going to restaurants, from chain restaurants to Michelin star restaurants, I have never been made to feel less \"valued\" as a customer than at Le Jardinier. The restaurant should be stripped of it's Michelin Star because of how poor the service is alone.\nMy wife and I have been looking forward to trying this place for months now as we saved up to take a Christmas trip into NYC. We were excited for the tasting menu most of all. We excitedly confirmed with our waitress that the tasting menu was gluten-free for my wife and let her know we were most likely going to do it. She leaves, says she'll come back to take a drink order, but she never returns. Instead, our first course shows up, and another guy eventually comes around to take a drink order. From that first course up until the dessert plates were cleared, our waitress never came back to check on us, never asked if we needed anything, no one asked if we wanted another glass of wine or a cocktail.\nThe waitress ignored us for the entire 2.5 hour ordeal. It wasn't a 2.5 hour ordeal to appropriately space the tasting menu mind you. If it was, they would have been interested in selling more drinks to us at the very least. The food was just slow.\nThe wait staff even dropped the desserts at our table without so much as a word about what was in them until we had to ask because my wife was nervous about the cookie-like thing on the bottom of hers. Meanwhile, the customers to our left and right were being waited on consistently by the waitress. She was chatting both tables up. Their water was constantly topped off. The disparity in service was so profound we both just wanted to leave by the fourth course.\n\nSo, how WAS the food? It was...fine. The first item, HIRAMASA, GRAPEFRUIT, JICAMA, AVOCADO MOUSSE, BAY LEAF, was fresh, good acidity and use of textures, and it was plated beautifully. It was a nice start to the meal for sure. The second item was SAVOY CABBAGE \"LASAGNA\" CELERY ROOT, HAZELNUTS, BLACK TRUFFLE.\"  It had a nice savory, earthy flavor profile to it and was pretty tasty. The third dish was surprisingly underwhelming, POACHED MAINE LOBSTER, CREAMY POLENTA, CORALINE BISQUE It was very one-note in it's flavor profile and my poached lobster was overcooked. Rather disappointing. The fourth course was the LONG ISLAND CRESCENT DUCK, ROASTED SALSIFY, KUMQUATS. The duck was just salty. If there was other seasoning on it, I couldn't tell because it was licking a salt cube. The cook was impeccable though, so they definitely get points for that. The dessert I had was THE PUMPKIN PATCH, AUTUMN SPICE CHEESECAKE MOUSSE, CANDIED GINGER ICE CREAM. It was visually impressive, but your mileage may vary depending on how you care for flavors like pumpkin or ginger. I will say though, their patissier is very skilled.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"YFj-MXv40mw","step_id":"gNVL27XpLv5","based_on_user_reviews":true,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1708870536165,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733418139499,"menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN"},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"fxdQco-QNoE","lon":-73.9887222,"lat":40.6921824,"title":"Shake Shack Downtown Brooklyn","total_recommendations":4,"selected_tags":["Lunch","Dinner","Open Late","Burgers","Grab & Go","Delivery","Take Away","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly","Pet Friendly","Bread Items","Desserts"],"address":"409 Fulton St, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA","last_review":"Lunch hour was busy and we waited 25 minutes for our food.

The entire place is dripping with tradition and class. The entire dining area is dimly lit, which really sets the mood, but it can make it hard to read the menu for people with poor eyesight. I had the ribeye as well as the A5 wagyu and both were delicious and some of, if not the best steak I have ever eaten. The somolier was incredibly knowledgeable and helped us in choosing the best wine for us. In addition, he gave us recommendations on where to find the wine in our home state of Maryland, and other wines that are similar to it that may be easier to find. Be warned, you are paying for quality here and you should definitely be prepared to spend hundreds of dollars if going with more than one person. Finally, they are extremely knowledgeable and accommodating to celiac/gluten free clientel. The server was easily able to tell us what entrees, sides, and desserts were able to be eaten. We had no gluten reactions and would easily trust them again to make a safe gluten free meal.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"JHlPPXnmxAU","step_id":"Gzn9uvQ1vN2","based_on_user_reviews":false,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1727089788361,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733416403092,"separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN"},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"GWtKwS2TNSb","lon":-73.9773368,"lat":40.7523458,"title":"Tartinery Café - Bar | Grand Central","total_recommendations":4,"selected_tags":["Breakfast","Lunch","Dinner","Brunch","Cafe","Cocktails","Delivery","Take Away","French","Kid Friendly"],"address":"105 E 42nd St, New York, NY 10017, USA","last_review":"The food is good, they have Gluten Free options, Fran served us and was very attentive and friendly, making sure that the food was gluten-free and everything was good.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"Ouck9p9ywt6","step_id":"GWtKwS2TNSb","based_on_user_reviews":false,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1727182474761,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733416371327,"separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN"},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"GNAn6UTSvym","lon":-73.8992074,"lat":40.7464884,"title":"SriPraPhai","total_recommendations":4,"selected_tags":["Lunch","Dinner","Delivery","Take Away","Outdoor Seating","Kid Friendly"],"address":"64-13 39th Ave, Flushing, NY 11377, USA","last_review":"#CeliacReviews: This beloved eatery has, on the surface, a bunch of gluten-free options but I am not confident it is celiac-safe.

It was a long anticipated evening to celebrate her birthday.  We were supposed to come a few years ago, but first the pandemic put a hold on our plans and then she had surgery, further delaying us.\n\nWe are both gluten free and dairy free and were really looking forward to the delicious options on your menu.   We asked the server to clarify the ‘cross’ symbol next to some of the options and wanted to know if those meant they were gluten free.  He said Yes, they were.  We also told him we were both gluten and dairy free.  We ordered the Vegan sherry glazed tofu, the miso glazed crispy eggplant and the autumn roasted vegetables.  For dessert we ordered the vegan brownie sundae.\n\nWe were curious about what some of the gluten free substitutions were on the items, such as the coating on the eggplant and the couscous-like ingredient with the tofu.  He told us he didn’t know what they used for the eggplant coating and he said the couscous-like ingredient was couscous, which of course is not gluten free.   We thought that was odd and we thought maybe he didn’t know what they used as a substitution.\n\nWhat we figured out later that evening, when my friend got very sick, was that he didn’t know about the menu, or that the ‘cross’ meant gluten free options available.   He just told us they were gluten free.   Unfortunately our fun couple of days in Manhattan turned into a shortened trip and had to head home to treat her symptoms.\n\nWe are typically very careful about making sure what we are getting is gluten free and dairy free, but we also need to rely on the servers to know how to accommodate us.\n\nI just wanted to make you aware and ensure that the servers are familiar with the gluten free options on your menu.   Hopefully it can prevent someone else from getting sick.","gf_criterias":{"_id":"xVhOM52tGX6","step_id":"wilDKcg4m9D","based_on_user_reviews":false,"celiac_friendly_override":"UNKNOWN","checked_by_atly":false,"created_at":1732064770254,"dedicated_gf_place":"UNKNOWN","menu_type":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_fryer":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_grill":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_oven":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_pots_pans":"UNKNOWN","separate_appliances_toaster":"UNKNOWN","separate_display_area":"NOT_APPLICABLE","separate_kitchen_space":"UNKNOWN","trained_staff":"YES","identity_data_for_analytics":"UNKNOWN","last_step_style_revalidation":1733419219231},"safety_level":"Accommodating"},{"_id":"whx-InZcMdX","lon":-73.98851549999999,"lat":40.748314,"title":"The Harold Bistro","total_recommendations":3,"selected_tags":["Breakfast","Lunch","Dinner","Brunch","Open Late","Delivery","Take Away","Kid Friendly","Restaurant"],"address":"1271 W 32nd St, New York, NY 10001, USA","last_review":"Nice lunch, pretty good burger.

When we asked for the original, they came out on cucumber again. The place felt a little chaotic when we first came in and even after being seated.
